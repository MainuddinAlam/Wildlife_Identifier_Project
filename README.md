# Wildlife_Identifier_Project
Machine learning project to identify wildlife animals.

Some notes to follow: -
1) Creat a folder in Collab folder called Wildlife Identifier Project
2) Place the Animals images' directory inside the project directory
3) Place the wildlifeIdentifier.ipynb file inside the project directory
4) Open the ipynb file in google collab and run the code shells

This was a helpful project for me to learn some aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks.
1) It helped me understand why data augmentation is quite important for small datasets
2) It helped me understand how different layers affect the training of the model

Note to myself:- It needs updating and more testing. I will do it in the near future.
